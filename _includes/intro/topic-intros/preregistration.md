*Transparent research practices* enable the research design, materials, analytic methods, and data to be thoroughly evaluated and potentially reproduced. This course presents current best practices and tools for increasing research transparency.

After the course, we expect the participants to be able to get started on improving their own research practices, assessing research transparency in articles they read and review. Toward these goals, we design this course with the following specific learning outcomes:

The course participantsâ€¦
* aware of decisions made in the course of quantitative research and the importance of making them transparent,
* know a range of practices, methods, and tools to improve research transparency,
* can apply principles to evaluate and compare the transparency of statistical and visualization techniques, and
* can preregister and deposit their research artifacts in FAIR repositories.
