We will start by introducing Bayesian statistical concepts, including prior and posterior distributions as well as the likelihood function. We will then walk through the implementation of several Bayesian models, and compare them with the frequentist analogs, followed up by extensions to these models with respect to increasing transparency. We will later focus on interpreting the posterior distributions of Bayesian models to estimate the probabilities of an effect.
